    I am currently a freshman at Northeastern University studying computer science. I started coding in high school thanks to the computer science program at Stuyvesant High School. There, I took computer science for three years with intro classes, AP classes, and a software development class.

  I enjoy going to hackathons (and their workshops) and meeting all the other amazing people there. My hobbies include running, playing/making music, and just walking around the city.
