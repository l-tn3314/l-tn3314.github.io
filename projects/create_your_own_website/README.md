#create_your_own_website

Wish there was an easy way to create your own website? Well you're in luck because create_your_own_website will ~~not~~ do just that for you! 


When you begin, you will get a blank canvas like shown below:

There are options to edit the background and navigation bar, and add sections, images, and lists.

Here is an example with a modified background and navigation bar:

Here is another example with what it looks like to add a section:

And if you want to add more sections...

Oh, did we mention that create_your_own_website is a ~~very much not~~ serious website-creating service?
Adding a list...

Fear not! If you don't like your website and would like to start from scratch, just click on the 'Reset Website' option!
But since we like what we've made, we want to click 'Generate Website' and download a copy of the beautiful website we just created! (Downloads as temp.html)

And if you open 'temp.html',

![alt tag](https://github.com/l-tn3314/l-tn3314.github.io/blob/master/projects/create_your_own_website/img/copy.png)

it's the beautiful website we just created!
