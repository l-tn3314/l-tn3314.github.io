					THE
			            FORBIDDEN
				      ISLAND
				       GAME

		        ———————————————————————————————

“You awaken alone, marooned on an island. You cannot recall how you got 
here, but desperately want to get back home. 

Around you are scattered pieces of machinery, which you suspect are 
important somehow. Looking up to the peak of the island, you see a 
somewhat ruined helicopter. How convenient that you are a trained 
pilot — and mechanic! You notice that the tide is rushing in:
 soon, the island will be flooded and the helicopter will be underwater. 

Can you collect all the pieces of the helicopter and fly away before 
it’s too late?”

     ///———————————————————GAMEPLAY INSTRUCTIONS—————————————————\\\

There are 3 types of islands in the Forbidden Island Game: MOUNTAIN, 
RANDOM, and TERRAIN.

- The MOUNTAIN island is diamond-shaped and built like a mountain, with 
the height the highest in the center and decreasing as you move away.

- The RANDOM island is diamond-shaped, but each Cell of the island has
a randomly-generated height.

- The TERRAIN island is randomly-generated terrain, with possible 
“lakes” in the middle and land jutting out from the sides.

	  	      ———————————————————————————————

Upon initial launch of the game, a TERRAIN island will appear with 
up to 5 Helicopter parts in randomly selected Cells of land, along 
with a Helicopter on the highest point of the island.

Every 10 ticks of the game, the Ocean surrounding the island will 
flood, eventually flooding the entire island - and the Player on it!

Collect all the Helicopter parts and the Helicopter itself while avoiding 
the water.

		      ———————————————————————————————

A SCUBA SUIT will also be randomly generated on the island. Collect 
the SCUBA SUIT and activate it using “B” - this will allow the Player
to swim through flooded Cells for a limited amount of time (displayed
on screen).

    /———-———————————————-———-SINGLE PLAYER-—-———————————————————\

Player 1 will spawn on a random land Cell on a randomly generated TERRAIN
island. Use the UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT arrow keys to move the Player 
around and collect all of the Helicopter parts BEFORE collecting the 
Helicopter. Your Score appears in the top left corner and will increase 
with each step you take - the lower the Score, the better! 

    /———-———————————————-———-MULTIPLAYER-—-———————————————————\

Press “2” to activate multiplayer mode - another Player will be 
generated in the center of the island. Use the “W”, “A”, “S”, and “D” 
keys to move this player around and help collect the Helicopter parts. 
BOTH players must make it to the Helicopter in order to succeed. 
Player 2’s Score will appear in the top right corner.
